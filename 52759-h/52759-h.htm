INFALLIBILITY.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Holy Scripture containeth all things
necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein,
nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that
it should be believed as an article of the faith, or be thought
requisite or necessary to salvation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sixth
Article of Religion</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we deny not those things that are written, so we
refuse those that are not written.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Jerome</i>. <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of God, therefore, is the only infallible
judge here; and has declared as plainly as any successive judges
can, in those things that are necessary to life and salvation,
what is to be believed and to be done; which if we believe and
practise in particular, and do also in general, and implicitly
believe and stand in a readiness to obey the rest of the
Scripture, when the sense thereof appears to us, we are in a safe
condition, and need not doubt but it will go well with us in the
other state.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Works of Henry More</i>, pp. 453,
454.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> reflecting Christian, as soon
almost as he is capable of reflection, must have continual
occasion to observe with sorrow and anxiety the multiplied
varieties of opinion that divide the Church of Christ, on every
point or article of Christian faith; the confidence with which
every sect lays claim exclusively to the possession of saving
knowledge, and the unqualified severity with which each party
reprobates the other, as being implicated in unpardonable
heresy.&nbsp; On hearing (and who can escape hearing?) the
fulmination of these mutual anathemas, we not only grieve for the
state of dreadful peril in which, if we admit such principles, a
large proportion of our neighbours, friends, and fellow
Christians must be involved: but we grieve likewise on <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>our own
account.&nbsp; We are visited with doubts, misgivings, and
apprehensions, lest we ourselves, through ignorance or prejudice,
should have adopted unawares into our creed some article
containing deadly error; or should have omitted something
indispensable to salvation.</p>
<p>In this state of intellectual and spiritual perplexity, if we
want the Christian industry and moral courage to work out for
ourselves, by the help of God, this greatest of all problems, we
are in a state of passive readiness to receive counsel from the
first adviser.&nbsp; Among the multitude of counsellors who
present themselves, none is more importunately obtrusive, or more
dictatorially confident than the Romanist; and I propose, for the
subject of this essay, to examine successively the remedies and
expedients he suggests for calming our disquietude, and restoring
our religious peace.</p>
<p>He informs us that our state of mind is the necessary
consequence of adhering to a Protestant communion; and that we
never can obtain repose and satisfaction until we enter the
Catholic Church&mdash;until, with the other wandering sheep
dispersed over the forbidden pastures of the earth, we return
with humble penitence to the fold which we have left; until, in
short, we renounce all dependence on the conclusions of uncertain
reason, and establish our Faith for ever upon the dictates of
infallibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;That there must,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;be some where upon earth an infallible living judge, an
arbiter of religious controversy incapable of error, an authority
from whose decision on points of faith there can be no appeal, is
a plain and obvious principle, which, on proper reflection, you
will find impossible to be rejected.&nbsp; Not to insist on
arguments from Scripture, although sufficiently conclusive, and
capable in themselves of proving that such an arbiter has been
appointed, there are independent considerations in favour of
infallibility which ought to satisfy every reasonable mind: for
the wise Creator of man would never grant a revelation to his
creatures, and then leave them to the direction of their own
erring judgment in ascertaining the truths revealed.&nbsp; The
benevolent Creator of man must know that man is fallible; that he
needs indispensably a conductor; and that without some infallible
conductor the benefits of revelation would <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>be doubtful and
precarious.&nbsp; But if infallibility exist at all in the
Church, it must exist in the Papal communion, which alone makes
the least pretension to the privilege.&nbsp; Therefore, only
reconcile yourself to our infallibly directed Church, and you
will no longer find occasion for uneasiness.&nbsp; You will be
guided safely through all the mazes of theological
disputation.&nbsp; Instead of being &lsquo;tossed to and fro, and
carried about with every wind of doctrine&rsquo; <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a> on a shoreless ocean of uncertainty and
error, you will repose with comfort and unruffled calm in the
quiet haven of infallibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the promulgation of these assurances our disquietude would
at once be tranquillized, if we could but persuade ourselves that
the promise of infallible direction, would be as certainly
fulfilled, as it is confidently made.&nbsp; But here lies the
difficulty.&nbsp; The assertions of our Romish counsellor are
bold, but the principle from which he argues is fallacious.&nbsp;
The assumed principle, that the human mind is capable of
prejudging what conduct the Creator must pursue towards his
creatures, or of pre-determining what benefits he must bestow, is
incompatible with our nature, and irreconcilable with experience.
<a name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a>&nbsp; We may perhaps admit, that if
infallibility be found at all in the Church, it must be found in
that branch which alone pretends to the privilege: but are we
warranted to conclude that God must have granted this
extraordinary privilege, merely because we think it likely, or
proper, or desirable, that He should grant it?&nbsp; Can we
safely infer, in any case, that God <i>must</i> have done what we
think it right that He should do; and make this inference
independently of all proof, that He has actually done so?&nbsp;
Is it not dictatorial, and hazardous in the last degree, to
determine by abstract reasonings, what line of conduct it would
be proper for an all-perfect, and all-wise Being to adopt, till
evidence appear <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>that He has really adopted it?&nbsp; We may indeed rest
assured, in general, that God will do nothing arbitrary or
irrational; but how often and how fatally should we be misled,
did we venture to predict that a certain course of Divine action
is alone rational, benevolent, and just&mdash;and, therefore,
<i>must</i> have been the course actually followed by the
Almighty!&nbsp; If we admit this mode of reasoning, and hazard
speculations of this kind, we should certainly think it
reasonable, that if God created sensitive beings, He would make
infallible provision against every error or mistake, which might
render them liable to fall from a state of holiness into a state
of guilt and misery.&nbsp; We should think it further reasonable
for Him to cause those most essential truths of religion, his own
existence and perfections, to rest on evidence infallible and
demonstrative; so as to preclude all doubt or hesitation in the
most sceptical inquirer.&nbsp; Or, (to suppose another case,) in
disputed questions of political importance among nations, since
war and bloodshed cannot otherwise be prevented, we should think
it reasonable for Him to appoint some great judge of
international law, by whom all differences might infallibly be
determined, and the blessings of tranquillity and peace secured
to all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p>But God has not fulfilled these expectations, though to all
appearance highly reasonable.&nbsp; He has left both men and
angels to the freedom of their own wills; and has created them
not only capable of abusing that gift of freedom, but of
involving themselves in sin and wickedness, and in everlasting
ruin.&nbsp; He has afforded no infallible, no demonstrative
evidence of his own existence and perfections; but has left
mankind to ascertain these fundamental truths from principles of
abstract reason, and by reflections on the works of nature and of
Providence.&nbsp; He permits contending nations to decide their
quarrels by an appeal to arms: and notwithstanding all the
mischiefs consequent upon war, has not thought fit to make that
effectual provision against this widely desolating source of
evil, which our human wisdom, if appealed to, would probably have
suggested; namely, the appointment of an unerring and
authoritative arbiter.&nbsp; We are, therefore, not entitled to
argue that God in his kingdom of grace must <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>unquestionably
have pursued a course, which, in his kingdom of Providence, He
has not pursued; nor to maintain that to silence all religious
controversies, He must indispensably have had recourse to an
expedient which, in political disputes, He has neglected.&nbsp;
We are not entitled to infer, that He must necessarily have
determined, by the authority of an infallible judge, the less
essential truths of religion; when He has left the fundamental
truths of all, to be determined by our own erring reason.&nbsp;
We are not entitled to infer, that the Creator of men must have
made infallible provision against their falling into heresy or
&ldquo;believing a lie,&rdquo; and thus frustrating the means for
their restoration to a state of holiness and happiness; when He
made no provision of that kind against their fall. <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>But granting to our Romanist adviser that his representations
were as sound as they are fallacious; still they could only lead
us to a probable, and never to an infallible conclusion.&nbsp;
The strength of the building must be proportionate to the
solidity of its foundation.&nbsp; If our faith in the supposed
infallible arbiter is to be founded on the validity <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and force of
the arguments and conjectures which have been stated; our faith
in the decisions of that arbiter cannot be greater than our faith
in the arguments and conjectures which support his
infallibility.&nbsp; Since these proofs, at the very utmost, are
any thing but demonstrations, and are only probabilities, we
cannot under any circumstances have more than probability to
guide us: and we therefore end as we began, and our disquietude
even on our admission of an unerring judge, remains exactly as
before.&nbsp; Our Romish advocate, however, is not
discomfited.&nbsp; He proceeds to affirm that the pretensions of
his Church are supported by analogy.&nbsp; He reminds us that the
Church of God, under the Jewish dispensation, was directed by an
infallible human authority; and that the same high privilege,
being equally wanted, might be equally expected in the Christian
&oelig;conomy.&nbsp; He quotes for this purpose those magnificent
assurances of God&rsquo;s peculiar favour and protection, to be
found throughout the books of Moses and of the prophets; and
relies especially on the remarkable rule established by the
legislator of Israel to this effect: &ldquo;If there arise a
matter too hard for thee in judgment, thou shalt come unto the
Priests, the Levites, and unto the Judge that shall be in those
days, and inquire, and they shall show thee the sentence of
judgment.&nbsp; And the man that will do presumptuously, and will
not hearken unto the Priest, or unto the Judge, even that man
shall die.&rdquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<p>To this argument from analogy we may reply, that the alleged
fact on which the analogy depends, is unfounded.&nbsp; The Jewish
Church was not infallible.&nbsp; The evidence adduced to prove it
so is totally inadequate; and unanswerable evidence may be
brought forward to prove it otherwise.&nbsp; With respect to the
text in question, it has not the remotest connexion with matters
of faith: it relates entirely to matters of civil
government.&nbsp; The introductory words of the passage, if
quoted fairly, and at full length, must satisfy every reader,
that they apply only to secular litigation: that what is here
enjoined by the Mosaic law is submission to the legal magistrate,
not assent to any article of Faith: that the contumacy here
forbidden under <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>penalty of death, was not heresy but rebellion; not
obstinate error, but obstinate disobedience.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, <i>between
blood and blood</i>, <i>between plea and plea</i>, <i>and between
stroke and stroke</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&rdquo; <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a>&mdash;an evident reference this to
civil litigation.</p>
<p>Besides, however encouraging the language of the Jewish
Scripture respecting God&rsquo;s &ldquo;everlasting
kindness&rdquo; to his &ldquo;chosen people,&rdquo; we know on
the authority of their own historians, that they went continually
wrong.&nbsp; Even in the days of undoubted divine interposition
we read that &ldquo;the people corrupted themselves, and turned
aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them.&rdquo; <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Aaron&rdquo; (their
supposed infallible guide) &ldquo;made a golden calf, and they
said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of
the land of Egypt:&rdquo; again, we are informed concerning
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, that &ldquo;he took counsel, and made
two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to
go up to Jerusalem, behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee
up out of the land of Egypt.&rdquo; <a name="citation7c"></a><a
href="#footnote7c" class="citation">[7c]</a>&nbsp; Further, it is
recorded of Elijah, that he complained of the Church of Israel,
as if it had entirely apostatized and disappeared from the
earth.&nbsp; He exclaims in his address to God, &ldquo;The
children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only
am left.&rdquo;&nbsp; We read of Ahab that he gathered his
prophets together, about four hundred men, and that there was
only one individual, Micaiah, &ldquo;a prophet of the
Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d"
class="citation">[7d]</a>&nbsp; Jeremiah laments over his corrupt
times, exclaiming, &ldquo;A wonderful and horrible thing is
committed in the land: the Prophets prophesy falsely, and the
Priests bear rule through their means; and my people love to have
it so.&rdquo; <a name="citation7e"></a><a href="#footnote7e"
class="citation">[7e]</a>&nbsp; Isaiah complains of the Jewish
priesthood in his time, under the figurative name of
&ldquo;watchmen,&rdquo; that they were &ldquo;blind,&rdquo; that
they were all &ldquo;ignorant shepherds that could not
understand.&rdquo; <a name="citation7f"></a><a href="#footnote7f"
class="citation">[7f]</a>&nbsp; But finally, to omit many less
remarkable instances of error and apostasy, our blessed Saviour
Himself was condemned by the Jewish Church and crucified.&nbsp;
Since therefore the Jewish Church was not infallible, the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>argument from
analogy, whatever value our Romish friend may attach to it, is
all distinctly on our side.&nbsp; If previous to the Christian
&aelig;ra no unerring director was appointed, none may be
appointed now.</p>
<p>The next resource of our ingenious disputant is to affirm,
that unless the Church possessed infallibility we could have no
certain nor infallible belief of the Scriptures, for which his
Church is our authority.&nbsp; To this sophism we can easily
reply, by corresponding cases.&nbsp; The copyists and librarians
who have preserved to us the Greek and Latin classics are not, on
that account, infallible expositors of classical antiquity.&nbsp;
Supposing, therefore, that we are exclusively indebted to
Romanism for transmitting to us the sacred oracles, it does not
follow that Romanists interpret them infallibly.&nbsp; It happens
also, (unfortunately for Romanist pretensions,) that we are not
indebted to any local tradition, such as that of the Church of
Rome, for the preservation of the canonical books of Scripture;
but to the universal tradition of Christendom.&nbsp; Perhaps we
are more under obligation to the Greek than to the Latin Church;
both because the writings of the New Testament were originally in
Greek, and because the chief authorities to prove their
genuineness and authenticity, as well as the earliest
enumerations of them are not Romish, but oriental productions. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>It thus appears that infallibility is not demonstrable by
abstract reasonings and analogies, but must be proved, if it be
proved at all, by direct evidence.&nbsp; To evidence of this
latter description we readily give attention, and request our
Romanist to inform us what he has to offer in the shape of an
explicit promise from God to support the claims of the Romish
Church.&nbsp; At the same time we give him warning, that before
he can satisfy our minds, he must lay before us full and
categorical information on the following particulars: namely,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By what organ the infallible oracles of Rome are
delivered.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By what evidence the claim to infallibility, as
existing in that organ, is established; and</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>3.&nbsp;
On what security we can rely, that our own fallible reason will
not mistake nor misconceive the doctrine propounded for our
belief.</p>
<p>Our desire of satisfaction on these points is not expressed in
any captious spirit, but is suggested by the necessity of the
case.&nbsp; For if we cannot infallibly discover in what person
or persons infallibility resides; if the Romanist cannot prove to
us by infallible arguments, that infallibility belongs to the
person or persons for whom he claims it; and if further, we
cannot obtain from our instructor in Romanism some infallible
security that we shall understand the doctrines proposed to us:
it plainly follows that the infallibility he so pertinaciously
insists upon, must be to us a matter of indifference, attended
with no one practical result.&nbsp; Our doubts and perplexities
will continue unresolved, and we shall be compelled to seek some
other guide to the peace and certainty we so anxiously
desiderate.</p>
<p>But unhappily in all these respects the promises of our Romish
advocate, the more they are examined, appear the more unstable
and unsafe.&nbsp; For first of all, when we inquire by what
<i>organ</i> the infallible oracles are promulgated; he is
obliged to acknowledge, that this important point has been for
ages a subject of much dispute, and a question very far from
being yet infallibly determined.&nbsp; Various are the
conflicting authorities, the whole of which it would be needless,
or perhaps impossible to enumerate. <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; Some learned
Romanists are of opinion that infallibility <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>is lodged in
the Roman Pontiff, as successor to St. Peter: others of equal
learning are inclined to place it in a general Council: a third
party, not conceiving that a Pope or Council singly is
infallible, ascribe infallibility to both in conjunction: and
fourthly, there are not wanting numerous and learned authorities
who insist that even the decrees of a general Council, ratified
by the Pope, are not to be accounted infallible, until they have
been received by the Church Universal.</p>
<p>This explanation is very far from satisfactory: for we thus
perceive, (according to the avowal of Romanists themselves,) our
liability to continual mistakes and misapprehensions respecting
the real quarter where infallible direction can be found.&nbsp;
If we take a Pope or Council singly for our guide, we have no
security for avoiding deadly heresy; for a Pope or Council singly
may be heretical.&nbsp; On the other hand, if we study to avoid
this danger by attaching our faith exclusively to a Pope and
Council in conjunction, (that is, to the decree of a general
Council ratified by Papal sanction,) we fall into another danger,
and may reject or omit some necessary doctrine, to which a Pope
or Council singly has affixed the seal of infallibility.</p>
<p>This admitted uncertainty as to the quarter of the earth
towards which we are to look for infallible guidance, is a ground
of fair presumption, perhaps even of demonstration, that
infallibility is in no quarter to be found.&nbsp; For the very
object of infallibility is the removal of all doubt; but doubt
can never be removed while the question, who is the remover of
it, remains unfixed, and impossible to be decided.&nbsp; To
receive assurances the most positive and solemn, that all our
doubts shall be resolved; and yet to be told that the authority
for resolving them is doubtful, is to use a cruel mode of
trifling with our simplicity.&nbsp; For it has been long and
painfully remarked, as the reproach of Romanists, that, on their
principles, the greatest controversy among Christians is, how to
fix the organ by which, or by whom, controversies shall be
unerringly determined. <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Finding
ourselves disappointed that this great question, in what place
the infallible oracle resides, remains still in agitation, we
next entreat our Papal adviser to explain the grounds on which
the several parties he has mentioned claim the lofty privilege
ascribed to them.&nbsp; And since a living judge, sitting
constantly in one spot, and therefore always ready to be
consulted, is incomparably more desirable as the organ of
unerring truth, than an assembly of divines, whom it is often
difficult to call together; we are all attention, waiting eagerly
to hear in the first place the claims of the Roman Pontiff, and
to receive, if possible, such clear and convincing arguments for
Pontifical infallibility, that henceforward we shall be able to
rely upon it with infallible assurance.</p>
<p>In compliance with this request, our Papal guide adduces what
he considers evidence from Scripture, and rests the Papal cause
upon the following declarations of our Lord.&nbsp; First,
&ldquo;Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
church;&rdquo; secondly, &ldquo;I will give unto thee the keys of
the kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven;&rdquo; thirdly, &ldquo;I have
prayed that thy faith fail not;&rdquo; and lastly, &ldquo;Feed my
sheep.&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>When we learn that these quotations are brought forward as
sufficient grounds for establishing an infallible assurance of
Papal infallibility, our first impression is of surprise: and our
surprise increases into amazement, the more we try to follow our
guide, and to rest an infallible assurance upon reasons so
uncertain and precarious.&nbsp; There is throughout the texts
quoted, no mention of the Roman Pontiff whatever, nor any
distinct allusion to the subject of infallibility.&nbsp; It
therefore seems extremely difficult to comprehend how any
reasoning man should thence infer that the Pontiff is
infallible.&nbsp; But here we are next given to understand that
his Holiness, as successor to St. Peter, inherits all the
privileges of St. Peter; and that what our Saviour promised to
that Apostle was not promised to him personally, but to his
successors in all ages.&nbsp; Yet, on examining <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the
authorities again, we find no warrant for the conclusion
asserted.&nbsp; There is nothing to assure us infallibly, nothing
which would even lead us to suspect that our Lord looked further
than to the Apostle himself, or conferred upon him any privilege
not shared in common with his brethren.&nbsp; Our Saviour&rsquo;s
prayer that the faith of Peter might not fail, and his subsequent
restoration of him to the Apostolic office by the thrice repeated
charge of &ldquo;Feed my sheep,&rdquo; have obvious reference to
the character and conduct of that disciple&mdash;at one time an
apostate, afterwards an accepted penitent.&nbsp; They can relate
to no other person, and to no other circumstances.&nbsp; And
&ldquo;it is absurd,&rdquo; as Bishop Stillingfleet observes,
&ldquo;to infer an impossibility in the Pope of falling, from a
promise to St. Peter of recovery&rdquo; and restoration. <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; Again, the promise,
&ldquo;whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven,&rdquo; <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> conveys no peculiar advantage or
pre-eminence to St. Peter; for the very same power is conveyed
afterwards by our Lord Himself to the whole number of the
Apostles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever
sins <i>ye</i> remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever sins <i>ye</i> retain, they are retained.&rdquo; <a
name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a>&nbsp; In respect to the privilege with
which that promise is introduced, &ldquo;I give unto thee the
keys of the kingdom of heaven,&rdquo; if these words really have
any meaning distinct from the power already mentioned of binding
and loosing, they refer prophetically to St. Peter, as the person
by whose instrumentality the gates of the Church would be opened
to mankind.&nbsp; And accordingly with one key the Apostle, on
the day of Pentecost, opened the gate of the Church to the
believing Jews and proselytes, when by the sermon which he
preached at Jerusalem he converted about three thousand souls;
and with the other key he afterwards opened the gate of <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the Church to
Cornelius and his friends, who were the first Gentile converts.
<a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<p>The declaration, &ldquo;Thou art Peter, and upon this rock <a
name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a> I will build my church,&rdquo; is a
text of very ambiguous meaning, and cannot therefore be the
ground of infallible assurance.&nbsp; We have no means of clearly
ascertaining whether our Lord refers to the person of St. Peter
as a foundation for the Church, or to the confession of St. Peter
made in the preceding verse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art the Christ the
Son of the living God.&rdquo;&nbsp; A large proportion of the
fathers, including Hilary, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact,
and Augustin, <a name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c"
class="citation">[13c]</a> understood our Saviour&rsquo;s
declaration as referring solely to the confession of Faith made
so distinctly and so zealously by the Apostle.&nbsp; The text
itself seems evidently to require the interpretation.&nbsp; To
speak strictly, Christ Himself is the sole foundation of the
Christian Church; and an Apostle could only be so in a secondary
sense.&nbsp; In this secondary sense, however, the Church is not
founded upon St. Peter only in particular, but on the Apostolic
college in general; as St. Paul more than once affirmed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye are built,&rdquo; he says to the Ephesians, &ldquo;upon
the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner stone.&rdquo; <a name="citation13d"></a><a
href="#footnote13d" class="citation">[13d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Other
foundation,&rdquo; he says to the Corinthians, &ldquo;can no man
lay.&rdquo; <a name="citation13e"></a><a href="#footnote13e"
class="citation">[13e]</a>&nbsp; And again, addressing the Church
of Corinth, (when the same inspired writer reckons up the
different gradations of Christian ministers,) he does not mention
St. Peter first, as nearer the foundation than any other member
of the Apostolic college; but speaks of the whole body in the
following general terms; &ldquo;God hath set some in his Church,
first Apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers.&rdquo; <a
name="citation13f"></a><a href="#footnote13f"
class="citation">[13f]</a>&nbsp; The Revelations of St. John
describe in like manner the wall of the holy city, as having <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&ldquo;twelve
foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the
Lamb.&rdquo; <a name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>There is not a vestige therefore of scriptural evidence, much
less an infallible demonstration, that the successors of St.
Peter, whoever they may be, are possessed of infallibility.&nbsp;
And supposing his successors to be infallible, there is not the
slightest scriptural ground for believing that his successors are
the Bishops of Rome.&nbsp; On this point, so vitally essential to
the Papal cause, the sacred writings are wholly silent.&nbsp;
They indeed inform us that this Apostle preached at Jerusalem, at
C&aelig;sarea, at Joppa, and at Antioch, but they no where even
intimate that he ever was at Rome: still less therefore can we
expect them to affirm that he was local Bishop of that See; and
least of all, that the Roman Bishops (in preference to the
Bishops in other churches of which he was the founder,) were
heirs of his peculiar privileges; and along with other Apostolic
privileges, inherited infallibility, while they lost the gifts of
miracles and of tongues. <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a></p>
<p>The absence of proofs from Scripture in favour of the Papal
claims, is by no means compensated by a plenitude of evidence
from antiquity.&nbsp; In ancient times the pretension to
infallibility, instead of being universally acknowledged, was not
even alleged.&nbsp; It was never so much as mentioned.&nbsp;
Churches and Fathers, in the primitive age, on occasions of their
dissenting from the Roman Pontiff, so far from yielding
reverently and implicitly to his opinions, openly contested them
like those of any other bishop, metropolitan, or patriarch.&nbsp;
Nay, they even sometimes excommunicated their infallible
superior. <a name="citation14c"></a><a href="#footnote14c"
class="citation">[14c]</a>&nbsp; The <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Roman Pontiff, on the other hand, so
far from crushing opposition by the verdict of infallibility,
endeavoured always to support his doctrine by the authority of
Scripture, of reason, or of antiquity.&nbsp; When appeals were
made to him by disputants in a later age, it was never stated or
imagined to be their ground of selecting him as their arbiter,
that his decision would be infallible; but only that he merited
such a tribute of respect, either in consideration of his private
character, as a wise, just, and holy individual, or by virtue of
his official rank as bishop of the imperial city. <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a></p>
<p>When Byzantium was raised to the same imperial eminence, by
the name of Constantinople, or New Rome, the Byzantine Patriarch
was declared by the second general council held <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 381, to be of equal dignity with his
Roman brother.&nbsp; Precedence only, or nominal priority, was
reserved to the episcopate of the more ancient capital.&nbsp;
This reservation was confirmed <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
451, by the fourth general council held at Chalcedon; in the
decrees of which the reason given for this nominal priority of
Old over New Rome is merely political, and has nothing to do with
spiritual concerns.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Fathers,&rdquo; say the
members of this later council (referring to their predecessors),
&ldquo;have justly assigned the eldership to the seat of elder
Rome&mdash;on account of the kingly or imperial authority of that
city (<i>&delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#8056;
&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8059;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;
&tau;&#8052;&nu; &pi;&#8057;&lambda;&iota;&nu;
&#7952;&kappa;&epsilon;&#8055;&nu;&eta;&nu;</i>), and they have
assigned equal privileges (<i>&tau;&#8048; &#7988;&sigma;&alpha;
&pi;&rho;&#8051;&sigma;&beta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</i>) to New
Rome, rationally judging that the city which was honoured by the
imperial power and by the residence of the Senate, and which
enjoyed equal privileges with Royal Rome, its elder sister,
should, like her, be exalted in ecclesiastical rank.&rdquo;
(<i>&pi;&#8057;&lambda;&iota;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;

name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>That
the Roman Bishops were never allowed to arrogate infallibility by
the ancient Church is further evident from the fact, that they
were not allowed even to claim supreme jurisdiction.&nbsp; The
Patriarch of Rome had no ecclesiastical authority beyond certain
provinces and churches termed suburbicary (<i>ecclesi&aelig;
suburbicari&aelig;</i>), including, at the most, certain
districts of Italy, together with the adjacent islands. <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; The other four Patriarchs (of
Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem,) were
entirely independent of their Roman colleague, and of each
other.&nbsp; When John, Patriarch of Constantinople, towards the
close of the sixth century, put forth a claim to supreme and
universal rule in the Church, encouraged in this insolent
pretension by the residence of the emperor within the limits of
his See&mdash;the Popes of that period, Pelagius and Gregory the
Great, resisted with great energy his pretensions; not however as
interfering with their own supremacy, but as being in themselves
presumptuous and anti-Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pay no
attention,&rdquo; says Pelagius, &ldquo;to the power which he
unlawfully usurps under the name of universality.&nbsp; Let no
patriarch ever apply to himself so profane a title.&nbsp; You may
foresee, my dearest brethren, the mischievous consequences from
such beginnings of perverseness among the priesthood.&nbsp; For
he (<i>antichrist</i>) is near, of whom it is written that he
maketh himself king over all the sons of pride.&rdquo; <a
name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;No one of my
predecessors,&rdquo; says Gregory the successor of Pelagius,
&ldquo;ever thought of using so profane an appellation; for if
one Patriarch assumes the title of universal, it is lost to all
the others.&nbsp; But far, very far be it from the mind of <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>a Christian,
to grasp at any thing by which he may appear in any the slightest
measure to derogate from the honour of his brethren.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; In another passage he thus
energetically addresses his overbearing fellow patriarch;
&ldquo;What wilt thou say to Christ, the Head of the Universal
Church, in the trial of the last judgment, who, by the
appellation of Universal, dost endeavour to subject all his
members to thyself?&nbsp; Whom, I pray, dost thou mean to imitate
in so perverse a word, but Him, who, despising the legions of
angels, constituted in fellowship with Him, endeavoured to break
forth unto the height of singularity, that He might both be
subject to none, and alone be over all?&nbsp; Who also said,
&lsquo;I will ascend into heaven, and will exalt my throne above
the stars.&rsquo;&mdash;For what are thy brethren, all the
Bishops of the Universal Church, but the stars of heaven, to
whom, while by this haughty word thou desirest to prefer thyself,
and to trample on their name in comparison with thyself; what
dost thou say, but I will climb into heaven?&rdquo;&nbsp; In
other places he brands the titles which John had assumed, as
&ldquo;pompous,&rdquo; &ldquo;foolish,&rdquo;
&ldquo;proud,&rdquo; &ldquo;perverse,&rdquo;
&ldquo;wicked,&rdquo; and &ldquo;profane:&rdquo; as names of
&ldquo;singularity,&rdquo; &ldquo;elation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;vanity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;blasphemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
insists that there was &ldquo;one sole Head of the Church, viz.
Christ,&rdquo; and sums up all with this strong prophetic
denunciation: &ldquo;I may confidently declare, that whenever any
man styles himself, or desires to be styled, universal priest,
such a man, by so exalting himself, becomes forerunner of
antichrist, because by pride he sets himself above his
brethren.&rdquo; <a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a></p>
<p>The attempts which have been made to reconcile the <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>indignant
language of Pelagius and Gregory, with the usurped prerogatives
of their successors, by ingeniously exaggerating the pretensions
of the Eastern Patriarch, are utterly ineffectual.&nbsp; Indeed,
if evidence were required to prove that the assumptions of the
Papacy in the present day are not inferior to those of the
Patriarch of the East, we need not go farther in quest of such
evidence than the Papal Brief of September last.&nbsp; For we do
not read that John of Constantinople ever ventured of his own
will and pleasure to extinguish two ancient archiepiscopal sees,
together with the whole diocesan Episcopate of both
provinces.&nbsp; We do not read that John ever had the hardihood
to abolish all the Constitutions and Canons, however ancient, of
an independent National Church, and to substitute for them the
<i>jus commune</i>, or common law of Constantinople.&nbsp; We do
not read that John ever presumed to grant territorial
designations, and titles of honour, to his own nominees, contrary
to the civil constitution of a powerful and independent kingdom,
within which those titles and dignities were to be assumed.&nbsp;
On the contrary, we know that John, so far from perpetrating
aggressions on the prerogatives of foreign sovereigns, was
entirely subordinate to the civil power of his own country, and
depended solely on the favour and authority of the emperor for
the support of his assumptions.&nbsp; And yet Pius the IXth
ventures to do what John of Constantinople never even attempted;
and has shut his eyes to the fact that he has thereby exposed
himself to the anathemas of his infallible predecessors.&nbsp;
Strong language has been used, (on some occasions too strong,) by
a justly indignant people in reprobation of his presumption; but
however strong that language may be, it has not as yet approached
the acrimony of the expressions used by Pelagius and Gregory the
Great on far inferior provocation.</p>
<p>We have seen that Scripture and antiquity are utterly
irreconcilable with the pretensions of the Papal chair.&nbsp; We
may now adduce the moral character of the Pontiffs themselves, as
a fair ground of presumption that they have not the privilege of
infallibility.&nbsp; If indeed we could be satisfied from history
that they had all, or most of them, in long succession, been
pious and holy and exemplary men, <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>in a degree beyond the ordinary
standard of Christian excellence; that they had been rich in
faith and in good works; that they had been exalted models of
disinterested beneficence, of real purity, and almost ascetic
moderation; men whose affections were fixed unquestionably upon
the glory and felicity of the heavenly state, to the exclusion of
all concern for mere earthly interests, and the little vanities
of secular ambition:&mdash;we might have been disposed to
scrutinize with less distrust the claims of such truly virtuous
and estimable Christian pastors.&nbsp; But since the Papal
character has been acknowledged even by the ablest advocates of
the Papacy, to have been in general the very opposite of what we
have been describing, we have a strong presumptive argument that
such men were not infallible. <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p>Other strong objections to Pontifical infallibility arise from
the want of any certain rule for determining the validity of
elections to the popedom, and for issuing the infallible
decrees.&nbsp; Before these decrees can be infallibly relied
upon, the following particulars must be infallibly ascertained:
who are the persons divinely entitled to give a vote in the
choice of a Pontiff? and how do those persons establish their
Divine title?&nbsp; What proportion of the voters are required by
Divine authority to be present, and what majority of numbers must
decide?&nbsp; How far shall simony, or fraud, or force, vitiate
the election?&nbsp; In case of two elections, how shall we
infallibly distinguish between the <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>claims of rival Pontiffs? between the
real Pope, whom, under the penalty of condemnation, we are bound
to obey, and the anti-pope, whom, under the same high penalty, we
must abjure?&nbsp; When schisms rend the Church (and not less
than twenty-six have rent the Church of Rome), how shall we
discern the true communion from the schismatical?&nbsp; And since
the Pope is supposed infallible only in his official, not in his
personal capacity, how shall we decide infallibly when he speaks
as an ordinary individual, and when as the successor of St.
Peter? in other words, what solemnities exactly are requisite to
be observed, for constituting a judgment <i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i>
from the Apostolic chair? what councillors must be summoned? what
mode of promulgation must be adopted? <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a>&nbsp; Such are some of the questions
which every candid Romanist must be desirous to hear definitely
answered, and which consequently must present themselves with
much greater force to every Protestant mind.&nbsp; When a
privilege so important as infallibility is understood to be
granted, all the circumstances necessary for our direction in
receiving and submitting to it, require to be distinctly and
indisputably revealed to us.&nbsp; Unless these circumstances are
fixed by the same authority that is supposed to make the grant,
namely, by Christ Himself, we are as far removed from
infallibility as ever; and in deciding these essential and
fundamental particulars, we are left to mere argument and
conjecture. <a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a></p>
<p>To disprove Papal infallibility much more will scarcely be
expected by our readers; but we will add one concluding
observation on the erroneousness and inconsistency of the
supposed infallible decrees.&nbsp; If Popes really were
infallible, their doctrine would never vary, but would remain,
from age to age, unalterably the same: the judgment of one Pope
would never differ, on the same subjects, from <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the judgment
of another; and least of all would it be credible that any Pope
should be convicted of heresy.&nbsp; We know, however, from
unquestionable documents of history that this was not the
case.&nbsp; Two Popes in the second century (Eleutherius and
Victor) were encouragers of the heretical fanaticism of Montanus.
<a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Another Pope (Stephen) of the
third century was heretical on the subject of baptism: <a
name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a> Pope Liberius condemned Athanasius,
and subscribed his name to the semi-Arian heresy: Pope Honorius
was by a general council condemned as a Monothelite. <a
name="citation21c"></a><a href="#footnote21c"
class="citation">[21c]</a>&nbsp; And (not to multiply particular
examples) we may remark, once for all, that a long line of Popes
promulgated, <i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i>, a doctrine which, in the
present age, is abandoned by Rome itself, and is rejected
universally as impious and extravagant; the doctrine, namely,
that the Roman See is vested with the Divine right of temporal
jurisdiction over all the kingdoms of the earth; and that the
Pontiff, as Vicar of Jesus Christ, and delegate of Him who is
King of kings and Lord of lords, may call civil magistrates to
account, and may depose kings and emperors, on the charge of
heretical depravity. <a name="citation21d"></a><a
href="#footnote21d" class="citation">[21d]</a></p>
<p>To these various objections against the doctrine of Pontifical
infallibility, our defender of the Roman Faith replies by a ready
acknowledgment that the great majority of Romanists themselves
are of our opinion: that much abler arguments have been urged by
them than by Protestants <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>against this pretension of the Pope:
<a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a> that by them infallibility is ascribed
not to the Roman Pontiff, who &ldquo;is liable to err, and who
frequently has erred;&rdquo; but to a general Council,
representing the whole Church of Christ, and combining all its
collective wisdom.&nbsp; On our inquiry by what Scriptural
evidence infallibility is proved to lodge in a representative
assembly thus constituted, we are desired to read the following
texts:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it.&rdquo; <a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee
as an heathen man and a publican.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22c"></a><a href="#footnote22c"
class="citation">[22c]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world.&rdquo; <a name="citation22d"></a><a href="#footnote22d"
class="citation">[22d]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pray the Father; and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit
of truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation22e"></a><a href="#footnote22e"
class="citation">[22e]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay
upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22f"></a><a href="#footnote22f"
class="citation">[22f]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;These things write I unto thee; that thou mayest know
how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is
the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the
truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation22g"></a><a href="#footnote22g"
class="citation">[22g]</a></p>
<p>Our endeavours to extract out of these texts infallibility for
the Romish Church are as much in vain as in the preceding inquiry
for supporting the Papal claims.&nbsp; A general council seems to
have as little warrant from Holy Scripture to assure us that it
is infallible, as the Roman Pontiff himself.&nbsp; The first
quotation refers to the perpetual <i>continuance</i> of the
Christian society.&nbsp; Christ assures us that, to the end of
time, the gates of hell shall not prevail against his Universal
Church; or, in other words, that a community called by his name,
and retaining the essentials of Christianity, will never cease to
be.&nbsp; But this consolatory promise gives us no security that
any one particular Church, or any meeting of Church officers,
shall <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>be
infallible.&nbsp; On this subject we cannot forbear transcribing
the judicious comment of a learned Romanist, Tostatus of Avila,
who flourished in the fifteenth century: &ldquo;The universal or
Catholic Church never errs, because it never errs in all its
branches.&nbsp; The Church of Rome (<i>ecclesia latinorum</i>) is
not the Catholic Church, but only a certain branch of it; and,
therefore, although the whole of that branch should have erred,
the whole Church could not be said to err.&nbsp; Because the
genuine Catholic Church remains in the unerring branches, whether
they be more or fewer than the branches which err.&rdquo; <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>Again, the injunction of our Lord to &ldquo;tell the
Church,&rdquo; if taken apart from, and not in connexion with the
preceding context, might seem to have some distant bearing upon
this question.&nbsp; But on examining the whole passage, we
perceive that our Saviour makes allusion to secular, not to
spiritual concerns; and is speaking only of private differences
among his followers.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thy brother shall trespass
against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three successive steps are next recommended
for effecting an accommodation: first a private interview; then
the influence of mutual friends; and lastly, the authority of the
Church to which the parties belong.&nbsp; The contumacious
wrong-doer who could not by these methods be brought to reason,
was no longer to be regarded as a Christian brother, but as a
heathen.&nbsp; He was liable to excommunication, or expulsion
from the society; and reparation of the injury committed might
now be sought for in a court of law.&nbsp; We do not find in
these directions the remotest allusion to infallibility.</p>
<p>The encouraging promise; &ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world,&rdquo; is not a grant of
infallibility, but a promise of assistance, protection, and
consolation; and was indispensably required, when our Lord
delegated to his Apostles the perilous labour of propagating the
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Gospel in
opposition to all the rulers of this world, sending them forth
&ldquo;as sheep among wolves.&rdquo; <a name="citation24a"></a><a
href="#footnote24a" class="citation">[24a]</a></p>
<p>His promise that the &ldquo;Spirit of truth&rdquo; should
&ldquo;guide them into all truth,&rdquo; relates entirely to the
extraordinary gifts with which they were endowed, and is
immediately connected with another promise, confessedly peculiar
to the Apostolic age.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rdquo; (the Holy Ghost)
&ldquo;shall show you things to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words, &ldquo;It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to
us,&rdquo; in the decree of the first council at Jerusalem, have
left no precedent for other councils to use the same language;
unless on separate evidence it can be shown that those councils
have the same authority of inspiration.</p>
<p>The position therefore, that general councils, as representing
the Church of Christ, are infallible, labours under a total want
of Scripture Evidence.&nbsp; There is not a single precept given
for assembling them; not one solitary rule for determining their
proceedings.&nbsp; As the learned Albert Pighius, an advocate of
pontifical infallibility, very justly argues: &ldquo;There is not
a word about general councils in the canonical books of
Scripture; nor did the primitive Church of Christ receive by
Apostolical institution any special direction respecting
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a>&nbsp; This able writer represents the
practice of summoning a general council in cases of
ecclesiastical emergency, to be an expedient piously introduced
by the Emperor Constantine for the purpose of composing the
dissensions of the Church.&nbsp; But the same author insinuates a
charge of great ignorance against the Emperor and his council,
who in adopting this course, appeared not to know that the
privilege of infallibility belonged to the Papal chair, and that
Rome was the proper Delphos where he might receive the infallible
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>oracles.&nbsp; This imperial ignorance is a remarkable
admission by the advocate of the Papacy in his zeal against
general councils.&nbsp; He succeeds in demolishing the latter;
but acknowledges at the same time a fact which is fatal to the
former.&nbsp; For if Constantine and the Bishops of his court
were ignorant of the papal pretensions, it must be obvious that
such pretensions either could not have been put forth at all, or
could not at that time have been generally recognized.</p>
<p>But if the Scripture, instead of being totally silent on the
subject, had plainly and categorically declared, that general
councils are infallible, we should only be involved in fresh
perplexities: for the question would immediately arise, <i>what
is a general council</i>?&nbsp; How do we know a spurious from a
genuine council?&nbsp; Councils have been assembled by opposite
parties on purpose to give opposite decrees; and how shall we
distinguish the fallible and heretical, from the orthodox and
infallible assembly?&nbsp; This vital question cannot be
determined by the numbers present, or the portion of the
Christian world represented by them.&nbsp; The orthodox
Athanasius was condemned successively by councils representing
the Eastern and the Western Church.&nbsp; Various councils
condemned by the Church of Rome for heresy, were as numerously
and respectably attended, as more orthodox conventions.&nbsp; The
Council of Milan consisted of 300 Bishops.&nbsp; At Ariminum not
less than 400 Bishops were assembled.&nbsp; The Council of
Ephesus included 10 Metropolitans and 130 Bishops.&nbsp; The
Council of Constantinople included 338 Bishops.&nbsp; And when
the rival Councils of Sardica and Philippopolis fulminated mutual
anathemas, the latter, which was heretical, consisted of 94
Bishops, while their orthodox opponents amounted only to
76.&nbsp; As most of these councils were convened by imperial
authority; represented large portions of Christendom; and
included men of the greatest learning and ability, there seems
nothing to distinguish them from other synods, which are
acknowledged to be general and infallible&mdash;nothing, if we
except the sanction of the Roman Pontiff.</p>
<p>Here we are informed by our pertinacious disputant, that the
papal sanction is commonly regarded in the Church <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of Rome, as
the essential distinction between a mere provincial synod, and a
general council; that the decrees of an alleged general council,
not ratified by the Pope, are not infallible; while the decrees
of any council, after that ratification, must be looked upon as
infallibly determined.</p>
<p>But our ingenuity must again be exercised in finding our way
through this labyrinth: for, first of all, no Scriptural reason
can be found, or is even pretended, for the limitation of
infallibility to councils of the description mentioned.&nbsp; The
authority, therefore, exists only in the well-stored imagination
of our Romish friend. <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; And in
addition, we are perplexed to ascertain how two authorities,
separately fallible, should become infallible by their
conjunction.&nbsp; The council is fallible.&nbsp; The Pope is
fallible.&nbsp; But unite these two fallibles, and you give them
infallibility.&nbsp; If it be asked, Is the council liable to err
which passes the decree?&mdash;Certainly, is the answer: for
otherwise the council would, without the Pope, be
all-sufficient.&nbsp; If it be further demanded, Is the Pope,
also liable to err who confirms the decree?&mdash;Certainly, is
again the answer: for he would otherwise be all-sufficient
without the council.&nbsp; This is a strange dilemma: we must
believe the decree to be infallibly determined, and yet must
neither ascribe infallibility to the council which passes it, nor
to the Pope who confirms it.</p>
<p>Another consideration is the uncertainty and arbitrariness of
this papal act of confirmation.&nbsp; The Protestant <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>must not take
for granted that the eighteen Councils, acknowledged by the
Church of Rome to be general, have the seal of St. Peter affixed
to all their canons and decrees.&nbsp; In some cases a general
council is partly confirmed and partly rejected (<i>partim
confirmatum</i>, <i>partim reprobatum</i>); <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a> in some cases neither confirmed nor
rejected (<i>neque approbatum neque reprobatum</i>): in some it
is pronounced uncertain whether the decrees are confirmed or
rejected; and in others they are confirmed by one Pope, and
rejected by another.&nbsp; Sometimes the general council did not
proceed with due form (<i>conciliariter</i>), or did not proceed
with due deliberation (<i>re diligenter examinat&acirc;</i>);
sometimes the questions to be determined were not stated with
sufficient clearness (<i>satis apert&egrave;</i>), and sometimes
there is a want of evidence whether the council was general or
provincial.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; exclaims Bishop Taylor,
&ldquo;is the greatest folly and most prodigious vanity.&rdquo;
<a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>Again, we might observe, that if infallibility be granted to
the Church through its representatives in a general council, the
privilege has been for many centuries in abeyance, and
(considering the aspect of Christendom) is never likely to be
renewed.&nbsp; And further, with respect to the reception of
these infallible decrees by provincial Churches, we might bring
forward the doubts which have prevailed among Romanists, whether
the decrees are binding immediately on being passed, or only
after they have been received. <a name="citation27c"></a><a
href="#footnote27c" class="citation">[27c]</a>&nbsp; Next with
reference to the doctrines which they inculcate, these are often
grievously contradictory to reason and Scripture.&nbsp;
Transubstantiation, for example, is contrary to reason.&nbsp; If
therefore we believe the infallibility <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>of general councils on grounds of
reason, the reasons against transubstantiation must be fairly
balanced in our minds with the reasons in favour of
infallibility.&nbsp; And as examples of contradiction to
Scripture, we might instance the adoration of the Blessed Virgin,
the worshipping of images and relics, the invocation of saints
and angels, purgatory, and the sacrifice of the mass.&nbsp; We
might then go on to show that if the infallibility of general
councils be Scripturally maintained, the texts adduced in support
of infallibility are to be weighed against the numerous and
explicit texts which oppose these corrupt doctrines and
idolatrous practices.&nbsp; Lastly, we might contend that, in the
primitive ages, when councils were continually assembled, neither
those councils themselves, nor any one writer who defended their
decrees, ever spoke of them as infallible.&nbsp; We need scarcely
add that councils could not be infallible without knowing it; nor
would hear their infallible decrees disputed without asserting
their infallibility.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Having now vainly endeavoured to procure conclusive
and satisfactory information on two of the essential points
indispensable for our conversion to Romanism; namely, first, by
what <i>organ</i> the infallible oracles are delivered, and,
secondly, by what <i>evidence</i> the claim to infallibility is
established; we proceed to the third and last topic of
investigation, and inquire on what <i>security</i> we can rely,
that we shall not misunderstand the doctrine propounded to our
belief?</p>
<p>We have already seen that the Romanist is unable to decide
with certainty in what person or persons infallibility resides;
and that he cannot prove the person or the persons for whom he
claims it, namely, a Pope or Council, jointly or severally, to be
infallible.&nbsp; Let us next consider, in conclusion, (and the
consideration need not occupy us long,) whether he is more
successful in establishing the third particular, which we began
by laying down as necessary to the tranquillization of our minds;
whether, in short, it can be proved to us incontestably, that we
shall comprehend with clearness and practical certainty the bulls
and canons promulgated for our guidance to the truth.</p>
<p>Security on this point is obviously indispensable.&nbsp; The
inspired volume is allowed by all Christians to contain <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>unerring
rules of faith and practice.&nbsp; But our erring reason, we are
told, is liable to misconceive them.&nbsp; Hence the supposed
necessity for another guide.&nbsp; But the very same liability to
error which exposes us to mistake in interpreting the Scriptures,
exposes us to mistake also in interpreting the bulls of a Pope,
or the canons of a general council.&nbsp; God Himself inspired
his chosen servants to write the Scriptures &ldquo;for our
learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; God nevertheless is misunderstood.&nbsp;
Neither Pope nor Council, therefore, is secure from being
so.&nbsp; Their decisions, jointly or separately, may be
misinterpreted through our weakness of apprehension.&nbsp; We
consequently need a new interpreter for expounding their
interpretation.&nbsp; But the expositions of this new interpreter
may, like those of his unerring predecessors, be erroneously
understood; and thus we should require an infinite series of
infallible guides, and at the end of this elaborate process we
should not be nearer to infallibility than we found ourselves at
the beginning. <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, we read, without surprise, that there are
disputes among Romanists in regard to the right construction of
their infallible decrees and canons; disputes as constant and as
vehement as those unhappily subsisting among Protestants, in
regard to the meaning of our inspired Scriptures. <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a>&nbsp; In the celebrated Council of
Trent, the last, and by the Romanists regarded as the greatest
ever held, many points of doctrine which had called forth the
most violent and argumentative disputation were purposely
expressed with ambiguity in the canons, that the consent of all
parties might be obtained.&nbsp; Even on that all-important
article of faith, respecting the proper object of religious
adoration, the Tridentine Fathers were satisfied with a vague
declaration, that &ldquo;due worship should be given to
images,&rdquo; without informing the conscientious worshipper,
(in a strait betwixt the danger of profaneness on one hand and of
idolatry on the other,) what kind of worship that doubtful phrase
was intended to imply. <a name="citation29c"></a><a
href="#footnote29c" class="citation">[29c]</a>&nbsp; It may be
also noticed that there are several controverted points in
religion, (the very points, in fact, most frequently contested
among Protestants,) <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>on which no unerring oracle has yet pronounced a
decision, and on which variations of opinion may be discovered in
the papal Church analogous to those prevailing throughout
Protestant communions.&nbsp; I allude to the numerous questions
connected with election, foreknowledge, predestination, grace,
free-will, and the perseverance of the Saints.</p>
<p>Nor will the force of our objections be evaded by the reply
that <i>actual</i> conformity of faith to the decisions of Popes
and Councils is not required; that <i>intentional</i> conformity
will suffice; and that every man, whatever be his errors and
misconceptions, is capable of salvation who is willing and
inclined <i>to believe as the Church believes</i>.&nbsp; For if
the Romanist is willing to believe as his Church believes, the
Protestant is willing to believe as the Apostles and Evangelists
believed.&nbsp; If then this willingness will suffice for the
Romanist, why should it not be sufficient for the
Protestant?&nbsp; If the one, when he falls into error, is held
excused by intentional conformity to the Romish creed, why should
not intentional conformity to the creed of the Apostles and
Evangelists excuse the errors of the other?&nbsp; Let this be
granted, and both parties are equally safe, equally infallible.
<a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>Thus we find that in all respects the Romish system fails to
afford the religious comfort and security we are endeavouring to
acquire.&nbsp; Our Romanist adviser has promised what he proves
himself incompetent to perform.&nbsp; He has held out to us the
enjoyment of an infallible assurance that we have attained to
sound doctrine, if we will only profit by the unerring oracles of
his Church; but he cannot point with certainty to the proper
organ of infallibility, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>nor establish on credible evidence
the claim of that organ to be infallible; nor give any positive
security that we shall understand infallibly the oracular truths
proposed to our assent.&nbsp; On the contrary, we have seen
abundant reasons for being morally certain, that the incapability
of error which he speaks of has no existence.</p>
<p>We have now sufficiently considered all the topics proposed
for discussion at the commencement of this essay; but before
concluding we must advert to one further point, too important to
be overlooked, which could not before be conveniently introduced,
viz., the newly-devised Theory of Development.&nbsp; We request
our Romish counsellor to inform us, whether in his judgment the
doctrines of modern Rome have the sanction of primitive
antiquity, and can be proved by the writings of the early
Fathers?&nbsp; He replies, that up to a very recent period he
would at once have answered in the affirmative; but that he is
now obliged to hesitate.&nbsp; &ldquo;From time
immemorial,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the doctors of our Church
unanimously insisted, and the Council of Trent infallibly
declared, that every article of our Creed was sanctioned by the
concurrent testimony of the Fathers, as many as were of the true
Church of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he proceeds,
&ldquo;within the last few years a party has arisen among us who
take a different view.&nbsp; Treatises have been widely
circulated and favourably received, in which it is maintained,
that the position of which we always boasted as our stronghold
is, after all, untenable; that antiquity must be abandoned; that,
in primitive times, our present doctrines were absolutely unknown
or imperfectly discovered; that Christianity, in the days of the
Apostles and for several centuries afterwards, was merely in an
embryo, rudimental state; that it has since been infallibly
developed; that St. Cyprian, St. Chrysostom, and St. Athanasius,
were only partially acquainted with many truths which have since
been canonically evolved and explained; and that, consequently,
the sanction of antiquity to any doctrine of modern Rome may be
as easily dispensed with as the authority of Holy
Scripture.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an example of development, our Romish
guide refers to the immaculate conception of the Blessed
Virgin&mdash;&ldquo;a doctrine,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;in
primitive times utterly unheard of; in the <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>middle ages
vehemently opposed; in later times gradually matured; and now at
last, in the nineteenth century, fully and pontifically
established under penalty of everlasting condemnation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This inability of the Romanist to determine whether Romanism
is or is not supported by antiquity, and whether it is a new or
an old religion, may be regarded as a climax to the difficulties
and perplexities in which, as we have already seen, his whole
system is involved. <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a></p>
<p>Besides the Romanist there are many other counsellors who,
with undoubting confidence, offer to relieve our minds from all
anxiety as to the soundness of our belief.&nbsp; Among these
parties I may now particularly mention the Sceptic and the
Mystic; because their systems, and that of the Romanist, however
opposite in other respects, have one essential point of
agreement.&nbsp; They all have a decided tendency to supersede
our own exertions for the discovery of religious truth&mdash;the
Sceptic by affirming that religious truth is unimportant; the
Mystic by alleging that religious truth is passively received by
the mind from divine illumination; and the Romanist by
inculcating an unconditional acquiescence in the dictates of
infallible authority. <a name="citation32b"></a><a
href="#footnote32b" class="citation">[32b]</a>&nbsp; This
remarkable coincidence suggests to us, that in respect to our
employment of means and opportunities, the way of truth is the
very opposite to the way of error; that the right path to saving
knowledge does not consist in the <i>disuse</i>, but in the
<i>strenuous exertion</i> of our intellectual and moral
faculties; that the inclination to improve our advantages for
attaining spiritual information is designed to try our <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>moral
character; and that we have a full security from deadly heresy in
the co-operation of Divine Providence, and of Divine grace with
our own sincere endeavours after truth.</p>
<p>This principle, which pervades the whole of Scripture, <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> is not to be confounded with the
fallacies above adverted to.&nbsp; We do not call it
infallibility, because we readily admit that rectitude of opinion
may exist, in various degrees, among persons, all of whom are in
the path of salvation.&nbsp; It differs from infallibility as
maintained by Romanists, because we do not consider any
individual, nor any number of individuals, to be incapable of
error.&nbsp; It differs from the infallibility of the enthusiast,
because we lay no claim to exemption from mistake: we insist only
that, using faithfully the means at our disposal, we shall escape
unpardonable heresy.&nbsp; It differs, thirdly, from the
infallibility of the sceptic, because he conceives all doctrines
equally excellent, provided their operation in society adapts
itself to his confined notions of moral duty.&nbsp; Whereas our
method implies that one doctrine differs materially, as to truth
and excellence from another, and that we are therefore bound to
select the best.</p>
<p>To make this selection of what is best, must be the paramount
desire of every rightly-disposed mind: and it now only remains
for us, before concluding this essay, to give some rules, as
briefly as we can, for determining our choice.&nbsp; Error and
misconception on this subject are so lamentably common, that even
our few imperfect suggestions may not be useless nor
unacceptable.&nbsp; We shall only premise that the spiritual
exercises which we recommend are arranged in the order here given
them, with a view to convenience and clearness; and not from an
impression that any of our readers can have occasion to begin
from the commencement of the series.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Our first rule is: to employ all the strength of our
faculties in the study and investigation of natural religion:
till we become impressed sincerely and practically with our awful
responsibility, as reasonable beings, to our Creator, Benefactor,
and Judge eternal.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>2.&nbsp; To establish clearly in our minds the evidences
and principles of Revelation; and to ascertain, by diligent
inquiry, that the Scriptures &ldquo;given for our
learning,&rdquo; are &ldquo;given by inspiration of God; and are
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and
instruction in righteousness.&rdquo; <a name="citation34a"></a><a
href="#footnote34a" class="citation">[34a]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To acquire a persuasion (according to the principle
asserted in the Scriptures, maintained by all antiquity, and
revived at the Reformation,) that the pages of Revelation are not
&ldquo;a sealed book&rdquo; to us; but that we are bound to
&ldquo;search the Scriptures,&rdquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> to &ldquo;prove
all things,&rdquo; <a name="citation34c"></a><a
href="#footnote34c" class="citation">[34c]</a> and &ldquo;to be
ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh us a
reason of the hope that is in us.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34d"></a><a href="#footnote34d"
class="citation">[34d]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; To satisfy ourselves that, on points of Christian
doctrine, our only real standard of faith is the Bible; and that
tradition (however useful as its interpreter and guardian) is
not, as Romanists contend, a co-ordinate authority with the
sacred text. <a name="citation34e"></a><a href="#footnote34e"
class="citation">[34e]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; To use in our interpretation of the inspired volume
all the helps within our reach; whether spiritual or temporal;
whether derivable from the living or from the dead.&nbsp; Among
these helps, the most important and indispensable are prayer and
a holy life.&nbsp; With respect to prayer, the promises in Holy
Scripture, that guidance to the truth shall be given to him that
asks it, are, as we have seen, numerous and indisputable. <a
name="citation34f"></a><a href="#footnote34f"
class="citation">[34f]</a>&nbsp; And as regards a holy life, or
the labours of the humble and diligent individual, who, from
desire to do the will of God, conscientiously exerts himself to
know it, our Lord Himself expressly declares, &ldquo;If any man
will do (&theta;&#8051;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;
&pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&#8150;&nu;, or is desirous to do)
his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation34g"></a><a href="#footnote34g"
class="citation">[34g]</a>&nbsp; To these helps may be added
others equally obvious, so far as they are consistent with the
opportunities, station, or profession of the
individual&mdash;such as familiarity with Scripture in the
original, knowledge of history, and particularly of the manners,
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>laws,
customs, and opinions of antiquity, Jewish as well as Christian;
joined to acquaintance with sound principles of Biblical
interpretation, criticism, and translation.</p>
<p>But a point which more particularly seems, under this rule, to
require illustration, is the <i>degree of value</i> at which the
conscientious inquirer after sound religious knowledge ought to
estimate ecclesiastical antiquity.&nbsp; Many pious individuals
(in their well-meant zeal against Romish errors) have thought
themselves obliged to discard ecclesiastical antiquity, under a
persuasion that by attaching any value to ancient writers, they
would violate the great Protestant axiom of resting on the sole
authority of God&rsquo;s written word.</p>
<p>But it should be considered, that to use ecclesiastical
antiquity for interpreting the word of God, no more violates this
axiom than to use any of the other universally admitted aids to
interpretation already mentioned.&nbsp; Whatever means the Divine
promulgator of Revelation has given to his Church for
ascertaining the truths revealed, ought diligently and
conscientiously to be improved.&nbsp; Among those means, the
place of highest authority belongs unquestionably to the three
primitive formularies of belief, the Apostles&rsquo;, the Nicene,
and the Athanasian Creeds; and to the Canons of the first four
general councils, which received the sanction of universal
Christendom: and in which to his entire satisfaction the
conscientious inquirer will find the leading truths of
Christianity embodied.&nbsp; The same remark applies to the
Episcopal constitution of the Church; for &ldquo;it is evident
unto all men diligently reading the Holy Scriptures and ancient
authors, that from the Apostles there have been these orders of
ministers in Christ&rsquo;s Church, Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons.&rdquo; <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; But we cannot better explain how
far ancient literature is to be rendered available to sacred
purposes, than by a transcription of a canon set forth by the
Church of England in the same year with its articles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Preachers shall not presume to deliver any thing from the
pulpit as of moment, to be religiously observed and believed by
the people, but that which is agreeable to the <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>doctrine of
the Old or New Testament, and collected out of the same doctrine
by the Catholic Fathers and the Bishops of the ancient
Church.&rdquo; <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;A wise regulation,&rdquo;
observes the judicious and able Dr. Waterland, &ldquo;formed with
exquisite judgment, and worded with the exactest caution.&nbsp;
The canon does not order that they shall teach whatever had been
taught by the Fathers: no; that would have been setting up a new
rule of faith; neither does it say that they shall teach
<i>whatsoever</i> the Fathers had <i>collected from
Scripture</i>: no; that would have been making them
<i>infallible</i> interpreters, or infallible <i>reasoners</i>:
the doctrine must be found first in Scripture, only to be the
more secure that we have found it there: the <i>Fathers</i> are
to be called in, to be, as it were, constant checks upon the
presumption or wantonness of private interpretation.&nbsp; But
then again, as to <i>private</i> interpretation, there is liberty
enough allowed to it.&nbsp; Preachers are not forbidden to
interpret this or that text, or hundreds of texts, differently
from what the Fathers have done; provided still they keep within
the <i>analogy of faith</i>, and presume not to raise any
<i>new</i> doctrine: neither are they altogether restrained from
teaching any thing <i>new</i>, provided it be offered as opinion
only, or as an <i>inferior</i> truth, and not pressed as
necessary upon the people.&nbsp; For it was thought that there
could be no <i>necessary</i> article of faith or doctrine now
drawn from Scripture, but what the ancients had drawn out before
from the same Scripture: to say otherwise would imply that the
ancients had failed universally in <i>necessaries</i>, which is
morally absurd.&rdquo; <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a>&nbsp; The canon
thus explained may be thought appropriate to preachers and
ministers alone, exclusively <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>of their people; but though the
latter cannot, it is true, directly apply this regulation to
themselves, they nevertheless may indirectly derive advantage
from it.&nbsp; They will be prepared to perceive at once when any
minister proposes to their acceptance some doctrine or exposition
of Scripture, for which he can produce no ancient
authority&mdash;and which he declares to be <i>new</i>, yet at
the same time <i>important</i>&mdash;he declares himself, by this
dangerous and un-canonical proceeding, unworthy of their
confidence.</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest and most alarming mistake to be
avoided by all inquirers, ecclesiastical or laical, is the
application of their minds to religious researches rather for the
sake of curious information and philosophical entertainment, than
for purposes of saving knowledge, and of sure, efficacious,
practical direction.&nbsp; The Holy Scriptures, no doubt, are
written for our learning, not however merely for such learning as
consists in literary, critical, and speculative exercises of our
ingenuity; but for our advancement in the school of Christian
wisdom, of that wisdom from above which unites and perfects all
the higher capacities of our nature, moral, intellectual, or
spiritual&mdash;that wisdom which, (far removed from the
jealousies and the wranglings and the violences of factious
controversy,) is anxious only for the interests of truth and
virtue&mdash;that wisdom which is &ldquo;first pure, then
peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and
good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.&rdquo; <a
name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a></p>
<p>In this course of wise and holy discipline, according to our
diligence, will be our progress; and proportioned to our
progress, will be our reward.&nbsp; Our anxieties,
discouragements, and despondencies will be left behind us.&nbsp;
We shall go on our way rejoicing.&nbsp; We shall feel a personal
interest in the glorious system of Christian redemption.&nbsp; We
shall enter daily more and more with satisfaction upon the duty
of examining ourselves, &ldquo;whether we be in the faith:&rdquo;
<a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a> and the result of that examination
will more and more enable us to see distinctly within our hearts
the lineaments of the Christian character.&nbsp; All the tests
from Scripture of such a progress will have a clearer application
to <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>our
spiritual state.&nbsp; Love to God, charity to mankind,
preference of divine to merely human objects, fervency in prayer,
frequency in meditation, attachment to religious ordinances,
self-control in the subjugation of our appetites and passions;
and in one word, likeness to Christ, increasing from day to
day&mdash;will assure us that to reach the gate of salvation we
have only to preserve the path which we have chosen.&nbsp; And
although, in this advanced state, enjoying &ldquo;a full
assurance of faith and hope,&rdquo; <a name="citation38a"></a><a
href="#footnote38a" class="citation">[38a]</a> we relax nothing
of our efforts, and, like St. Paul, &ldquo;count not ourselves to
have apprehended the price of our high calling,&rdquo; <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a> yet we exclaim triumphantly with the
same Apostle: &ldquo;Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ?&nbsp; Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?&nbsp; In all these
things we are more than conquerors through him that loved
us.&nbsp; For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation38c"></a><a

<h2>SIDE NOTES.</h2>
<p>In the printed book Rev. Sinclair printed side notes in the
margins to explain the points he was trying to make.&nbsp; As
these made the text itself difficult to read, and added little
value to the narrative, in this transcription they are placed
here, together with the pages on which they occur, so that the
development of the points can be seen in overview.</p>

that the argument from &ldquo;motives of credibility,&rdquo; as
they are termed, is in this view more presumptuous and
objectionable than the claim so loudly and so vehemently objected
against Protestants.&nbsp; Surely there is more presumption in
claiming a right to prejudge what God <i>must</i> have done, than
in claiming the right of private judgment to ascertain what God
<i>has</i> actually revealed.</p>

fit (you say) for deciding of controversies, to have, besides an
infallible rule to go by, a living infallible judge to determine
them: and from hence you conclude, that certainly there is such a
judge.&nbsp; But why then may not another say, that it is yet
more useful, for many excellent purposes, that all the Patriarchs
should be infallible, than that the Pope only should?&nbsp;
Another, that it would be yet more useful, that all the
Archbishops of every province should be so, than that the
Patriarchs only should be so.&nbsp; Another, that it would be yet
more useful, if all the Bishops of every diocese were so?&nbsp;
Another, that it would be yet more available that all the parsons
of every parish should be so?&nbsp; Another, that it would be yet
more excellent, if all the fathers of families were so?&nbsp; And
lastly, another, that it were much more to be desired, that every
man and every woman were so? just as much as the prevention of
controversies is better than the decision of them; and the
prevention of heresies better than the condemnation of them; and
upon this ground conclude, by your own very consequence, that not
only a general Council, not only the Pope, but all the
Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Pastors, Fathers&mdash;nay, all
the men in the world, are infallible?&nbsp; If you say now, as I
am sure you will, that this conclusion is most gross, and absurd,
against sense and experience, then must also the ground be false
from which it evidently and undeniably follows, viz., That that
course of dealing with men seems always more fit to Divine
Providence, which seems most fit to human
reason.&rdquo;&mdash;Works of Chillingworth, vol. i. p. 296.</p>

deny the infallibility of the present Church, and only make the
tradition of all ages the infallible propounder: yet if you were
agreed what and what only is the infallible propounder, this
would not satisfy us; nor yet to say, that all is fundamental
which is propounded sufficiently by him: for though agreeing in
this, yet you might still disagree whether such or such a

there be any certainty that every Pope is a good Christian, or

<p>The same learned Cardinal whom Chillingworth here refers to,
is very zealous throughout his works in defending Papal
infallibility, and even ventures to affirm (Bellarm. de Pontifice
Rom. lib. iv. cap. 5, in fine), &ldquo;If the Pope could or
should so far err, as to command the practice of vice, and to
forbid virtuous actions, the Church were bound to believe vices
to be good, and virtues to be bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pontiffs,
whatever they may have thought of this extraordinary theory, seem
in <i>practice</i>, by the Cardinal&rsquo;s own account, to have
availed themselves, in a considerable degree, of the privilege
which he claims in their behalf.&mdash;See also Works of Henry
More, p. 450.</p>

find, the alleged fallible head of an infallible body is actually
liable,) he may be lawfully deposed by a general council.&nbsp;
Such being the case, they must, on their own principles,
inevitably hold the infallibility of a general council even when
<i>not</i> sanctioned by the papal confirmation: for it is quite
clear, on the one hand, that no <i>prudent</i> Pope, at least,
would ratify the sentence of his own deposition, or confirm the
decree which pronounced him to be a schismatic or a heretic; and
it is equally clear, on the other hand, that no general council
could infallibly pronounce the Pope to be a heretic or
schismatic, himself all the while stiffly denying, as of course
he <i>would</i> deny, the offensive allegation, unless such
general council, <i>independently</i> of any papal ratification,
were <i>itself</i> constitutionally
infallible.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Faber&rsquo;s Difficulties of
Romanism</i>, p. 247, 248.</p>

introduce the well-known example of implicit faith, recorded by
various writers, and which has met with different degrees of
Roman Catholic praise and of Protestant censure.&nbsp; An
ignorant collier of the Romish persuasion was asked, what it was
that he believed, and answered, &ldquo;I believe what the Church
believes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The questioner rejoined: &ldquo;What then
does the Church believe?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied: &ldquo;The
Church believes what I believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other, anxious
for particulars, resumed his interrogatories: &ldquo;Tell me,
then, I pray you, what is it that you and the Church both
believe?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which the collier could only give this
answer: &ldquo;Why, truly, sir, the Church and I both believe the
same thing.&rdquo;&mdash;Campbell&rsquo;s Lectures, vol. ii. p.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
